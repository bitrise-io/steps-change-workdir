title: "Change Working Directory for subsequent Steps"
summary: Changes Bitrise source directory (`BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`) to a specified path.
description: |-
  This Step changes Bitrise source directory (`BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`) to a specified path.

  By setting `$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` to the specified path every subsequent
  Step will run with this path as its base Working Directory.

  Useful for projects which expect a fixed project/workspace hierarchy,
  like `Go` which requires the project inside a "workspace" with
  the structure: `$GOPATH/src/domain/user/project`.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the new **Directory path**.
  2. Enable or disable the creation of the **Directory path** in case it doesn't exist yet.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Please make sure that you set a correct and existing **Directory path**. You must define this value.
